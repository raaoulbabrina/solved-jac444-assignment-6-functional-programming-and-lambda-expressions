<br>
This assignment lets you practice basic Functional Programming and Lambda Expressions in Java.

In this assignment, you will be adding some code to the workshop 2 (shapes) as follows:

<u>Task 4:</u> Define a functional interface to calculate the area of a shape. Create an object of that interface in each of the <strong>Circle, Square, Rectangle </strong>classes, <em>using lambda expressions</em>.

Print all the shapes and their perimeters polymorphically, as you did in task 1 (don’t forget that you are using <em>just one</em> <strong>Shape</strong> array) but in cases that the shape being printed is an object of these classes (i.e. <strong>Circle, Square, Rectangle</strong>), print their areas (<em>using the above mentioned objects you created</em>) as well.

<strong>Marking Criteria and Tasks:</strong>

Please note that you should:

a- have appropriate indentation. b- have proper file structures and modularization. c- follow Java naming conventions. d- document all the classes properly. e- not have debug/useless code and/or file(s) left in assignment.

f- have good intra and/or inter class designs.

in your code!

<ul>

 <li>Task: Developing and running the desired solution: <strong>(you should submit your source code – just individual .java files, and screenshots which demonstrate the way your code runs): 5 marks. </strong></li>
